# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
# #   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# days_array = (2..10).to_a

# (1..100).to_a.each do |num|
#   Blog.create(title: "Blog #{num}", content: "Some amazing content ##{num}.",, published_date: [days_array.sample.days.ago, Date.yesterday, Date.today].sample)
# end

# # Blog.create(title: "The random title", content: "This great stuff")

# puts "Finished Seeding Database"
